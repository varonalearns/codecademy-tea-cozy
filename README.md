# Codecademy - Front-End Engineer Path - Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy

## Overview

This is my solution to the Off-Platform Project: Tea Cozy that can be found on the [Front-End Engineer path from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer)

### The Challenge

In this project, I'll create a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

### Requirements

Use the provided design spec to complete the project:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- I put to the test what I have learned so far from the Front-End Engineer path. 

### Continued development

- Something I would like to come back to in this project is making the website mobile friendly. Maybe even designing my own version of Tea Cozy? That is something to think about for the future.
